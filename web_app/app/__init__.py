# web_app/app/__init__.py

# This file is typically empty in a Django project. It is used to ensure the directory is treated as a Python package.
# If you need to execute some code when the app package is initialized, you can add it here.

# As of now, no initialization code is needed for our web app, so this file remains empty.
